# Processing structured data  - US Alines Analysis

**Disclaimer:** The task instructions are in Polish, and the presentation language is in Polish. English translation is provided for README documentation purposes.
## Overview
This repository encompasses the collaborative effort of our group for the PDU (Practical Data Analysis) course during the academic year 2022/2023. The project delves into the analysis of airline on-time performance data, aiming to extract meaningful insights.

## Project Focus
Our primary objective is to explore diverse facets of airline on-time performance using the provided dataset. This dataset spans from October 1987 to April 2008, covering crucial details such as departure and arrival times, carrier information, delays, and more.

## Repository Structure
- **`presentation/`**: Contains presentation slides (PDF or HTML) showcasing our analysis results.
- **`scripts/`**: Encompasses all R scripts, Python modules/scripts, and notebooks instrumental in data analysis and result generation.
- **`data/`**: Placeholder for the dataset. Please download the dataset (`airline_on_time_data.csv`) from [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7) and place it in this directory.

## Key Questions Explored
Our exploration focused on answering a range of questions related to airline on-time performance, including but not limited to:
1. What is the optimal time of day/week/season to minimize delays?
2. Do older aircraft experience more delays?
3. How does passenger traffic change between different locations over time?
4. What is the impact of weather on aircraft delays?
5. Can cascading failures be detected, where delays at one airport cause delays at others?

## Presentation Highlights
We presented our findings on [XIV or XV class] as per the course schedule. The presentation provided an overview of the most compelling results derived from our analysis.

## Running the Code
1. Ensure R and/or Python is installed on your machine.
2. Download the dataset (`airline_on_time_data.csv`) from the provided [Harvard Dataverse link](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7) and place it in the `data/` directory.
3. Navigate to the `scripts/` directory and execute the relevant scripts or notebooks to reproduce the analysis results.

## Evaluation Criteria
The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Inclusion of code necessary for loading datasets and generating presented results.
- Development of code generating interesting results answering research questions.
- Presentation of results in a clear and concise manner within the allocated time.
